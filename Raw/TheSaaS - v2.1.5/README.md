# TheSaaS

TheSaaS is a responsive, professional, and multipurpose SaaS, Software, Startup and WebApp landing template powered by Bootstrap 4. TheSaaS is a powerful and super flexible tool, which suits best for any kind of landing pages. TheSaaS is definitely a great kick starter for your web project.

TheSaaS design is harmonious, clean and user friendly. Even though the template has a lot of content, it doesn’t looks messy and all files and code are well structured, commented and divided. TheSaaS has a huge collection of plugins and UI components and works seamlessly on all major web browsers, tablets and phones.

## What's included

Within the download package you'll find the following directories:

```
thesaas/
├── starter/
├── theme/
└── v1.5/
```

- `starter`: It includes starter templates to get started with. This is the place you should choose a starter, copy a directory and start your project with. There's a complete documentation inside a readme.html file for each starter template.
- `theme`: This directory contains all the files that you see in the online demo. You should use these files to copy codes or files from and develop your own project. Also, it's a documentation and reference for our components.
- `v1.5`: The previous major release of TheSaaS which is included for thousands od customers who has developed their project based on the v1.x.

## Versioning

For transparency into our release cycle and in striving to maintain backward compatibility, TheSaaS is maintained under [the Semantic Versioning guidelines](http://semver.org/). Sometimes we screw up, but we'll adhere to those rules whenever possible.

See CHANGELOG.md for list of changes in each release.


## Upgrade from TheSaaS v1.x to v2.x

This is the second major release of TheSaaS which is based on the stable release of Bootstrap 4. The previous version (v1.x) is based on the Bootstrap 4 alpha-6. As the version number implies, this release contains a lot of breaking changes due to breaking changes from Bootstrap 4. So there's not any guide on how to upgrade from TheSaaS v1.x to TheSaaS v2.x. Since the v1.x is already stable enough, you don't have to upgrade your project at all—unless you have enough time to recreate it using the current release of TheSaaS. But if you're starting new project, TheSaaS v2.x is the right choice.
